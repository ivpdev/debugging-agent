I suspect the compiler is hacked, so the program is not running correspondently to it's code.

Inpsect the state of the program after user enters the guess. Check is the guess is corresponding to the entered value. Check if the number to be guessed stays the same inside of the programm. Check that if the guess and number equal each other the exection enters the corresponding section of the program.

Do the whole debugging session by youself without asking the user for help.
