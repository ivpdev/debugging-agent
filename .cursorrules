The AI assistant must NOT create, modify, rename, or delete any files unless the user explicitly says to do so.

Allowed:
- Explain existing code
- Suggest changes in chat only
- Provide diffs or code snippets for review

Not allowed:
- Apply edits automatically
- Create new files
- Delete files
- Rename files

If an action would modify files in any way, the assistant must ask for explicit permission first.

Do not add comments unless absolutely necessary.

Prefer `const` over `var`. Use `var` only if the variable must be reassigned later.

Only make changes directly related to the current task. Do not fix or refactor unrelated code in files you touch.
